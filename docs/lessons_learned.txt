Folder naming is important
Root folder:
.\docs
.\docs\custom_errors.txt
.\files
.\source
readme.txt

General (LV):
Use spaced names so its easier with crlt+space+k to craft icons

Template actor:
Required overrides inside VIs that are not dynamic dispatch
Typdefs as private instead of protected
Accessors for base class must be overridable
Need typedefs for Actor Events, State Machine Control and FP References
Write error handling strategy and derive from it
Use map to keep track of nested actors
Actor core must be a required override
Create template up to 90%, then create error handling actor, return to template and finish it. Only then, derive to other required actors
No need for error testing button
Do not use error ring
